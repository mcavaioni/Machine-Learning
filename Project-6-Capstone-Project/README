This paper applies and analyses different state-of-the-art algorithms for image recognition, using the MNIST and SVHN 
(Google Street View House Numbers) dataset.

ALGORITHMS AND FILES DESCRIPTION:
   MNIST dataset analysis:
   1. SVM:
    - "mnist_lst.py" downloads the images 
    - "vect_data.py" imports the images from the previous file in order to plot a sample
    - "svm.py" runs the SVM classifier

   2. MLP:
    - "classifier.py" runs the MLP classifier


   SVHN dataset analysis:
   1. MLP:
    - "load_real_images.py" download the images
    - "real_classifier.py" runs the MLP classifier

   2.CONVOLUTIONS (KERNELS):
    - "convolution.py" applies different kernels to the images 

   3.CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK: (this runs with TensorFlow)
    - "convolut_sv2.py" creates the model for the Convolutional Neural Network and runs 
      predictions
