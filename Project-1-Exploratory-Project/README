In this optional project, I have to create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic 
disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. 
It starts with a simple algorithm and increases its complexity until I am able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 
80% of the passengers in the provided data.
