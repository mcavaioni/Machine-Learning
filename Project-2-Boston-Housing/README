Project Overview
In this project, I apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area
to predict the selling price of a new home. I first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics 
about the dataset. Next, I properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance 
metric for this problem. I then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set 
sizes. This will enable me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I will test this optimal 
model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to the statistics.

Project Highlights
This project is designed to get acquainted to working with datasets in Python and applying basic machine learning 
techniques using NumPy and Scikit-Learn. 

Things learned fduring this project:
How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
How to evaluate a modelâ€™s performance on unseen data using previous data.
